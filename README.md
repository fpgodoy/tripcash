# Tripcash <h1>

**Tripcash is a web-based aplication, using Python, to deal with the finances of your trip.**
Using it, you can register all your expenses and, then, list or sum them by date and label.

Made starting from the [tutorial available in the official Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/) and prepared to deploy using Heroku.com.

This is my final project of [CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/)
